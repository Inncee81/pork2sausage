Pork 2 Sausage is a plugin for Notepad++.

I got a lot of feature requests to transform the selected text from A to B, such from a clear text to a zip text encoded in base64, or from an url encoded text 
to a clear (decoded) url. Some of them are easy to be implemented in C or C++ and some are not. On the other hand, those one which are complex to be implemented 
in C or C++ can be done in Java or .NET in very few lines thanks to their rich libraries. 

AS its name indicates explicitely, this plugin can transform a pork to the sausage(s). Unlike in the real world, it is able to turn the sausage(s) back to a pork. To do so you need a transformer to transform the selected text in Notepad++ to whatever you want. All you have to do is setup your transformer (an executable program) in a ini file of Pork 2 Sausage plugin. You transformer should take input from a file or stdin and generate output to a file or stdout. User can customize upto 20 commands.

Enjoy
